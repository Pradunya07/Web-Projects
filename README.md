# Web-Projects

Here are 3  web developments projects I worked on while learning web development.

1.<strong> Code Player</strong> - A code player where you can write HTML, CSS and Javascript code seperately  in different blocks and see the final output page simultaneously.                                   You can toggle between these 3 blocks + output block while working.  

2.<strong> Secret Diary</strong> - Here the user can create his personal diary(account) where he can log his ideas, thoughts and writings securely. The writings will is saved                                      in real time in database using Ajax.

3.<strong> Weather</strong> - While learning to use API and different ways to get data from a website this project was created. It's a simple website that displays the weather                               conditions of a place as per user input.
